"""
A form batch is a vectorized form with n primitives transformed into a simpler
representation: one primitive repositioned n times.

On certain backends this leads to more efficient drawing. For example, SVG can
be shortened by using <def> and <use> tags, and raster graphics can render the
form primitive to a back buffer and blit it into place for faster drawing.

Batching is an optimization transform that happens at draw time. There's
currently no mechanism to manually batch. E.g. contexts cannot have FormBatch
children.
