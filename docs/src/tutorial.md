# Tutorial


## Compose is declarative

In a declarative graphics system, a figure is built without specifying the
precise sequence of drawing commands but by arranging shapes and attaching
properties. This makes it easy to break a complex graphic into manageable parts
and then figure out how to combine the parts.

## Everything is a tree

Graphics in Compose are defined using a tree structure. It's not unlike SVG in
this regard, but has simpler semantics. There are three important types that
make up the nodes of the tree:

* `Context`: An internal node.
* `Form`: A leaf node that defines some geometry, like a line or a polygon.
* `Property`: A leaf node that modifies how its parent's subtree is drawn,
  like fill color, font family, or line width.

The all-important function in Compose, is called, not surprisingly, `compose`.
Calling `compose(a, b)` will return a new tree rooted at `a` and with `b`
attached as a child.

That's enough to start drawing some simple shapes.

```@setup 1
using Compose
set_default_graphic_size(4cm, 4cm)
set_default_jsmode(:exclude)
```

```@example 1
using Compose

composition = compose(compose(context(), rectangle()), fill("tomato"))
draw(SVG("tomato.svg", 4cm, 4cm), composition)
nothing # hide
```

![](tomato.svg)

The last line renders the composition to specificied backend, here the SVG
backend. This can also be written like
`composition |> SVG("tomato.svg", 4cm, 4cm)`.
Alternatively, if multiple compositions of the same size are to be
generated, this can be abbreviated even further to

```
set_default_graphic_size(4cm, 4cm)
composition |> SVG("tomato.svg")
composition2 |> SVG("celery.svg")
composition3 |> SVG("rutabaga.svg")  # etc...
```


## The compose function accepts S-expressions

In the first example, we had to call `compose` twice just to draw a lousy red
square. Fortunately `compose` has a few tricks up its sleeve. As everyone from
lisp hackers and [phylogeneticists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format)
knows, trees can be defined most tersely using S-expressions. We can rewrite our
first example like:

```julia
# equivalent to compose(compose(context(), rectangle()), fill("tomato")))
compose(context(), rectangle(), fill("tomato"))
```

Furthermore, more complex trees can be formed by grouping subtrees with
parenthesis or brackets.

```@example 1
composition = compose(context(),
        (context(), circle(), fill("bisque")),
        (context(), rectangle(), fill("tomato")))
composition |> SVG("tomato_bisque.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](tomato_bisque.svg)

## Trees can be visualized with introspect

A useful function for visualizing the graphic that you've constructed is
`introspect`. It takes a `Context` defining a graphic and returns a new graphic
with a schematic of the tree.

```@example 2
using Compose # hide
set_default_graphic_size(6cm, 6cm) # hide

tomato_bisque =
    compose(context(),
            (context(), circle(), fill("bisque")),
            (context(), rectangle(), fill("tomato")))

introspect(tomato_bisque)
```

This is a little cryptic, but you can use this limited edition decoder ring:

```@example 2
using Compose, Colors, Measures
set_default_graphic_size(6cm, 4cm)

figsize = 6mm
t = table(3, 2, 1:3, 2:2, y_prop=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
t[1,1] = [compose(context(minwidth=figsize + 2mm, minheight=figsize),
                  circle(0.5, 0.5, figsize/2), fill(LCHab(92, 10, 77)))]
t[2,1] = [compose(context(minwidth=figsize + 2mm, minheight=figsize),
                  rectangle(0.5cx - figsize/2, 0.5cy - figsize/2, figsize, figsize),
                  fill(LCHab(68, 74, 192)))]
t[3,1] = [compose(context(minwidth=figsize + 2mm, minheight=figsize),
                  polygon([(0.5cx - figsize/2, 0.5cy - figsize/2),
                           (0.5cx + figsize/2, 0.5cy - figsize/2),
                           (0.5cx, 0.5cy + figsize/2)]),
                  fill(LCHab(68, 74, 29)))]
t[1,2] = [compose(context(), text(0, 0.5, "Context", hleft, vcenter))]
t[2,2] = [compose(context(), text(0, 0.5, "Form", hleft, vcenter))]
t[3,2] = [compose(context(), text(0, 0.5, "Property", hleft, vcenter))]
compose(context(), t, fill(LCHab(92, 10, 77)), fontsize(10pt))
```

## Contexts specify a coordinate system for their children

In addition to forming internal nodes to group `Form` and `Property` children, a
`Context` can define a coordinate system using the `context(x0, y0, width, height)`
form. Here we'll reposition some circles by composing them with contexts using
different coordinate systems.

```@setup 3
using Compose
set_default_graphic_size(4cm, 4cm)
```

```@example 3
composition = compose(context(), fill("tomato"),
        (context(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5), circle()),
        (context(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), circle()))
composition |> SVG("tomatos.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](tomatos.svg)

The context's box (i.e. `(x0, y0, width, height)`) is given in terms of its
parent's coordinate system and defaults to `(0, 0, 1, 1)`. All the children of a
context will use coordinates relative to that box.

This is an easy mechanism to translate the coordinates of a subtree in the
graphic, but coordinates can be scaled and shifted as well by passing a
`UnitBox` to the `units` attribute.

```@example 3
composition = compose(context(),
        (context(units=UnitBox(0, 0, 1000, 1000)),
         polygon([(0, 1000), (500, 1000), (500, 0)]),
         fill("tomato")),
        (context(),
         polygon([(1, 1), (0.5, 1), (0.5, 0)]),
         fill("bisque")))
composition |> SVG("tomato_bisque_triangle.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](tomato_bisque_triangle.svg)


## Measures can be a combination of absolute and relative units

Complex visualizations often are defined using a combination of relative and
absolute units. Compose makes these easy. In fact there are four sorts of units
used in Compose:

* **Context (position) units**: If no unit is explicitly attached to a position, it is
  assumed to be in “context units”, which are relative to the parent Context's
  box and coordinate system. (Constants: `cx`, `cy`)
* **Context (relative position) units**: The radius of a form can be expressed in size units 
  with respect to the context units (Constants: `sx`, `sy`). If no unit is explicitly attached to
  a size (e.g. radius) unit, it is assumed to be wrt the context `x` units. More info below.  
* **Width/Height units**: Sometimes you'll want place geometry in relative
  coordinates, but bypassing the parent context's coordinate system.
  Width/height work so that `(0w, 0h)` is always the top-left corner of the
  context, and `(1w, 1h)` is always the bottom-right. (Constants: `w`, `h`)
* **Absolute units**: Absolute units are inches, centimeters, points, etc.
  (Constants: `inch`, `cm`, `mm`, `pt`)

Any linear combination of these types of units is allowed. For example, `1w - 10mm` is a well formed expression, giving the width of the parent canvas minus ten millimeters. An example of the difference between
context position units (`cx`, `cy`) and size units (`sx`, `sy`), is when the coordinate system (defined by `UnitBox`) does not start at `(0,0)`, then the size `0sx` (or `0sy`) will always equal `0mm`, but the position `(0cx, 0cy)` will be dependent on the coordinates (and may refer to a point outside the context's `UnitBox`).


## Forms and Properties can be vectorized

Often one needs to produce many copies of a similar shape. Most of the forms an
properties have a scalar and vector forms to simplify this sort of mass
production.

We'll use `circle` as an example, which has two constructors:

```julia
circle(x=0.5w, y=0.5h, r=0.5w)
circle(xs::AbstractArray, ys::AbstractArray, rs::AbstractArray)
```

The first of these creates only circle centered at `(x, y)` with radius `r`. The
second form can succinctly create many circles (using the [Colors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Colors.jl) package to specify the `LHCab` colorspace):

```@setup 4
using Compose, Colors
set_default_graphic_size(4cm, 4cm)
```

```@example 4
composition = compose(context(),
        circle([0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]),
        fill(LCHab(92, 10, 77)))
composition |> SVG("circles.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](circles.svg)

The arrays in passed to `xs`, `ys`, and `rs` need not be the same length.
Shorter arrays will be cycled. This let's us shorten this last example by only
specifying the radius just once.

```@example 4
composition = compose(context(),
        circle([0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.1]),
        fill(LCHab(92, 10, 77)))
composition |> SVG("cycled_circles.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](cycled_circles.svg)

The `fill` is a property can also be vectorized here to quickly assign different
colors to each circle.


```@example 4
circles_fill_vectorized = compose(context(),
        circle([0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], [0.1]),
        fill([LCHab(92, 10, 77), LCHab(68, 74, 192), LCHab(78, 84, 29)]))
circles_fill_vectorized |> SVG("circles_fill_vectorized.svg")
nothing # hide
```

![](circles_fill_vectorized.svg)

If vector properties are used with vector forms, they must be of equal length.


## Compose can produce arbitrary directed graphs

Though we've so far explained `compose` as producing trees, there's nothing
stopping one from producing an arbitrary directed graph. This can be quite
useful in some cases.

In this example, only one triangle object is ever initialized, despite many
triangles being drawn, which is possible because the graph produced by
`siepinski` is not a tree. The triangle polygon has many parent nodes than
“re-contextualize” that triangle by repositioning it.

```@example 5
using Compose, Colors # hide
set_default_graphic_size(8cm, 8*(sqrt(3)/2)*cm) # hide

function sierpinski(n)
    if n == 0
        compose(context(), polygon([(1,1), (0,1), (1/2, 0)]))
    else
        t = sierpinski(n - 1)
        compose(context(),
                (context(1/4,   0, 1/2, 1/2), t),
                (context(  0, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2), t),
                (context(1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2), t))
    end
end

composition = compose(sierpinski(6), fill(LCHab(92, 10, 77)))
composition |> SVG("sierpinski.svg", 8cm, 8*(sqrt(3)/2)*cm)
nothing # hide
```

![](sierpinski.svg)

There are no safeguards to check for cycles. You can produce a graph with a
cycle and Compose will run in an infinite loop trying to draw it. In most
applications, this isn't a concern.

## Fancier compositions

There are fancier forms of the `compose` function, in particular, variadic
`compose`, which is roughly defined as:

```julia
compose(a, b, cs...) = compose(compose(a, b), cs...)
```

Compose over tuples or arrays:
```julia
compose((as...)) = compose(as...)
```

In effect, this lets one write a complex series of compose operations as an
S-expression. For example:

```julia
compose(a, b, ((c, d), (e, f), g))
```

Since all we are doing is building trees, this syntax tends to be pretty
convenient.

## [Forms](@ref forms_gallery)

These are basic constructors for the in-built forms - see the [Forms gallery](@ref forms_gallery) for examples.

* `polygon(points)`
* `rectangle(x0, y0, width, height)`
* `circle(x, y, r)`
* `ellipse(x, y, x_radius, y_radius)`
* `text(x, y, value)`
* `line(points)`
* `curve(anchor0, ctrl0, ctrl1, anchor1)`
* `bitmap(mime, data, x0, y0, width, height)`
* `arc(x, y, r, angle1, angle2, sector)`
* `sector(x, y, r, angle1, angle2)`
* `bezigon(anchor0, sides)`

## [Properties](@ref properties_gallery)

Properties include `arrow`, `fill`, `fillopacity`, etc. See the [Properties gallery](@ref properties_gallery) for examples.
For colors, Compose supports the colors available in [Colors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl), which includes many [color spaces](http://juliagraphics.github.io/Colors.jl/stable/), hex strings, and [named colors](http://juliagraphics.github.io/Colors.jl/stable/namedcolors/).


## Text

Symbols can be used in text strings by inserting [HTML
codes](http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm).  More general formatting for the SVG
backend is [documented here](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/text.html),
whereas the Cairo backend uses a [Pango markup
language](https://developer.gnome.org/pango/unstable/PangoMarkupFormat.html).

```@example 6
using Compose # hide
cents_ina_dollar = compose(context(), text(0.5, 0.5,"100&#162; in a &#36;"))
cents_ina_dollar |> SVG("dollar.svg",5cm,1cm)
nothing # hide
```

![](dollar.svg)

Use the `font` and `fontsize` properties to change the appearance of type:

```@example 7
using Compose # hide
compose(context(),
       (context(), text(0.2,0.5,"big"), fontsize(18pt)),
       (context(), text(0.4,0.5,"small"), fontsize(6pt)),
       (context(), text(0.6,0.5,"bold"), font("Helvetica-Bold")),
       (context(), text(0.8,0.5,"oblique"), font("Helvetica-Oblique"))) |>
    SVG("font_fontsize.svg",15cm,1cm)
nothing # hide
```
